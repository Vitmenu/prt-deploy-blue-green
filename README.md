# A Simple Example of Blue-Green Deployment

## Summary
This repository serves as an example of the blue-green deployment strategy. It is designed to help individuals **practice** the deployment process before delving into the development of a CI/CD pipeline.

## Explanation: What's the *blue-green deployment*?

The blue-green deployment strategy is a technique used in software development to minimize downtime and ensure smooth deployments. By maintaining two identical environments, referred to as the "blue" and "green" environments, developers can seamlessly switch between them during deployments. This approach allows for testing and validation of the new version in the green environment while the blue environment continues to serve production traffic. Once the green environment is deemed stable, the switch is made, and the green environment becomes the new production environment.

By using this repository as a reference, users can gain hands-on experience with the blue-green deployment strategy and become familiar with the necessary steps and best practices. It provides a safe environment for practicing deployments and understanding the benefits of this deployment approach.

Feel free to explore the contents of this repository and follow the provided instructions to gain a better understanding of blue-green deployments.
